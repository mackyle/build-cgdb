README_SOURCES
==============
The cgdb source release tarballs are archived in this directory 1)
to make sure they are available to build from and 2) because they
are small enough that there would never be a size concern.

Note that the originals were tar.gz but the archives in this directory
have been converted to tar.bz2 to save some space (23% smaller).

The original source locations and hashes for the original archives
are recorded here as well as the hashes for the bz2 versions included
in this directory.
